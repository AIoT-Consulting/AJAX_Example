# Description:
The webpage is actually working well, and the numers are updating correctly as per the frequency of the timeout, but I'm getting an error on the development console which I do not understand.
An example of the error is: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getElementsByTagName') at XMLHttpRequest.response ((index):49:26) at process ((index):68:11) at <anonymous>:1:1
