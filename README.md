# Having issues with my XMLHttpRequest.


# Description:
The webpage is actually working well, and the numers are updating correctly as per the frequency of the timeout, but I'm getting an error on the development console which I do not understand.
An example of the error is: 
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getElementsByTagName') at XMLHttpRequest.response ((index):49:26) at process ((index):68:11) at <anonymous>:1:1

I've reviewed my html & script but do not understand what I'm doing wrong.

See images bellow.
The first image shows the error appearing in the console
The second image shows the location (line 49 of the index file) where the error is occuring.
